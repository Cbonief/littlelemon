## General Overview.

In this project, we built a web application using the backend framework Django. The application features the website for a fictitious restaurant called Little Lemon. In the website the customer can view the restaurant's menu, which is in a MySQL database on the backend server. 
The website also allows for customers to book a reservation at the restaurant. 

The database that contains the menu, users and reservations was created using Django's models. Each page itself was built using Django's HTML Templates and just a little bit of Javascript where thing needed more responsivenes.
